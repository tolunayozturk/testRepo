	<strong>What You Will Create</strong>
</h2>
<p>In this codelab, you will use the demo project that has been created for you to experience LocationBarrier APIs of Awareness Kit. Through the demo project, you will experience developing a scenario where you can measure users' length of stay in a certain location;</p>
<ul>
	<li>Defining a specific district for the barries</li>
	<li>Adding an ENTER barrier</li>
	<li>Adding an EXIT barrier</li>
	<li>Measuring users' length of stay in that district</li>
</ul>
